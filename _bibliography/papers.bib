  title={Control of real power in a synchronous machine using a SCADA system in a smart grid},
  author={Espinoza, F and Mar,M },
  abstract={Today smart grids are changing the current concept of power systems. It brings a lot of benefits for energy companies and customers. The paper is one of the first steps in the research of this topic in Peru. The main goal of this work is to design and test a SCADA system for controlling real power in a synchronous generator. The test were made in the Smart Grids system laboratory at UTEC (Universidad de Ingeniería y Tecnología).},
