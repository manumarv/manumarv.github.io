We tested the vehicle software and hardware reliability on track in Lucas Oil Raceway located in Brownsburg, Indiana 

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.liquid path="assets/video/LOR_2023_11/FullLap_2023-11_540p.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true autoplay=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.liquid path="assets/video/LOR_2023_11/VID-20231120-WA0015.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true %}
    </div>

<div class="caption">
    These videos show the vehicle running in an oval at max speed of 55mph, due to physical and safety the constraints the speed limit of this track for autonomous vehicle is 60mph. 
</div class="caption">

    Some of the outcomes of this test were the verification and validity of the controls and localization algorithm we tested on simulation. Additionally we integrate all of our software stack in the car. We verified that the safety triggers were pushed.
