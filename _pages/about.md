Greetings! I am currently a PhD Candidate at the Polytechnic School at Purdue University. I earned my bachelor’s degree in Power Engineering at University of Engineering and Technology (UTEC) in Lima Peru, I worked in energy consulting for almost 2 years. Then I did my master’s in computer information technology at Purdue University Polytechnic Institute focusing in Machine Learning and Electric Vehicle Powertrain Design. I am currently under the guidance of Dr Dietz and working with Professor Samuel Labi with autonomous racing cars.
